# Slugpoints Exchange
2023 ACM Hackathon Submission. Basic code for a Discord Bot that makes it easy for discord users to exchange slug points for goods and services. 

For this to work you have to fill in your own ID's Manually and run the python script. Be sure to install the discord python libraries as well to make sure it works. On my machine typing  "pip install -U discord.py" worked for me but may vary from platform to platform.
